# Coding Tools Box

A toolbox of time-saving scripts to speed up and smooth out your coding workflow.

## Overview

This repository contains two main components:
1. A collection of useful coding tools and scripts designed to enhance your development experience
2. Environment configuration scripts for setting up common development environments

The toolbox is continuously growing with new utilities being added regularly.

## Components

### 1. Coding Tools

#### 3D Tools
- **Rigid Transform**: Tools for 3D rigid transformation calculations
- **Visualization**: Utilities for 3D scene and data visualization
- **View Sphere**: Tools for view sphere calculations and visualization

*More tools are being added regularly...*

### 2. Environment Configuration Scripts

The `envs/` directory contains scripts for setting up various development environments:
- Zsh configuration and customization
- Docker environment setup
- Other common development environment configurations

These scripts are independent of the coding tools and can be used separately.

## Getting Started

### For Coding Tools

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yang-yang-o-o/tools.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific tool directory
```bash
cd code/[tool-name]
```

3. Follow the tool-specific instructions in each tool's directory

### For Environment Setup

1. Navigate to the desired environment configuration
```bash
cd envs/[environment-name]
```

2. Follow the setup instructions in each environment's directory
